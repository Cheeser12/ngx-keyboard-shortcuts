<h4>This is an example of a simple keybinding demo!</h4>
This component contains a single listener that is currently set to listen for a keybinding, specifically Ctrl + M.
Press Ctrl + M to see it in action!  The handler of this listener will trigger a simple alert message when it hears the proper keybinding.
