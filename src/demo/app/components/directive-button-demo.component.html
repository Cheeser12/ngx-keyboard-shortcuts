<h4> Showing How the Directive Works</h4>
<br />
<button [keyboardShortcut]="keyboardShortcutDef" (click) = "alertMessage()">directive</button>
<br /> 
<br /> 
<p> 
    The directive is to make a shortcut for a button. So if there was a close button on your 
    page then you would be able to make a hotkey that does what the button would do. In 
    this instance we will be clicking the directive button and an alert will show up. Now 
    try to click Ctrl + i and the same alert will show up.

    If you look at the code provided it gives you the ability to call a message via the button 
    click or by just using the directive selector. This makes it much easier to use a directive 
    and will let you go back to make easy changes.
